The main focus of this 20 minute design challenge is to add 'floating' borders to the card as you see in the picture above. Figure out how to introduce extra elements to the existing layout in order to achieve the desired effect.

You might want to look up pseudo-elements on MDN â€” more specifically `::before` and `::after`.

Be creative with your solutions, it doesn't have to be complicated `:)`
